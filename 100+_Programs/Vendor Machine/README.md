## Consider a vending machine that offers the following options:
[1] Get gum <br/>
[2] Get chocolate <br/>
[3] Get popcorn <br/>
[4] Get juice <br/>
[5] Display total sold so far <br/>
[6] Quit <br/>

Design and implement a program that continuously allows users to select from
these options. <br/>
When options 1–4 are selected an appropriate message is to be
displayed acknowledging their choice. <br/>
For example, when option 3 is selected the
following message could be displayed: <br/>
`Here is your popcorn`
<br/>
When option 5 is selected, the number of each type of item sold is displayed. For
example:
```
3 items of gum sold
2 items of chocolate sold
6 items of popcorn sold
9 items of juice sold
```
When option 6 is chosen the program terminates.<br/>
 If an option other than 1–6 is entered an appropriate error message should be displayed, such as: <br/>
Error, options 1-6 only
